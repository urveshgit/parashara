   <strong>"Parashara"</strong> name of Website.
   <h4>Why Parashara</h4>
    <strong>Parashara</strong> was a maharshi and the author of many ancient Indian texts. He is father of Indian Astology.
    He is one of the Saptarishis and guru of Sri Ram.
    He is accredited as the author of the first Purana, the Vishnu Purana, before his son Vyasa wrote it in its present form.
    He was the grandson of Vasishtha, the son of Śakti Maharṣi, and the father of Vyasa.
    There are several texts which give reference to Parashara as an author/speaker.
    Modern scholars believe that there were many individuals who used this name throughout time whereas others
    assert that the same Parashara taught these various texts and the time of writing them varied.
    The actual sage himself never wrote the texts; the various texts attributed to him are given in reference to
    Parashara being the speaker to his student. He is the third member of the Ṛiṣhis Paramparā of the Advaita Guru Paramparā.
